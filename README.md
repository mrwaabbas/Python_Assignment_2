# Data
This dataset on evictions in NYC was retrieved from NYC Open Data the goal was to identify which borough was experiencing the highest number of evictions: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/about_data

I uploaded the raw data into python and cleaned up the data in Jupyter notebooks.

# Methodology
The notebook folder shows my code in the Jupyter Notebooks where I read the CSV file into a DataFrame and used Python to count the number of evictions per borough in order to determine which one had the highest total.

I also calculated the mode to see if a particular neighborhood was experiencing disproportionately high eviction rates, and whether it was located in the same borough with the overall highest rate.

# Analysis Summary
My analysis and research/reporting of the data is included in the output folder with the new cleaned up data exported from Jupyter Notebooks

The data tells the story of the Bronx, a borough in NYC that experiences racial and economic inequities as shown in the high number of evictions. While evictions are only a part of the issues that persist in the Bronx, this data shows how the economic inequities they are experiencing are showing up.

This data can be used to tell a story about how developers and landlords may be taking advantage of rent payers here. It can also be a story about how housing policy fails residents in New York. The data can also be used to go into more details about zip codes and see if there are developers or landlords who are monopolizing housing in specific areas.
